Here, users can customize recording settings such as room dimensions, robot start and end points, and the robot's movement steps. Obstacles within the room can be added and customized, and incorrect additions can be easily removed. Additionally, users can define recording parameters like duration and performance metrics. Within this dashboard, technical users can simulate the path using arrow keys on the keyboard."
